# NLP Interview Analysis

As part of my Bachelor Thesis, I have been experimenting with natural language processing algorithms to come up with a way to assess the persona of entrepreneurs, without relying on mostly unscientific quantitative-based leadership tests. 

Many startup founders from my network received a questionnaire consisting of 10 questions, focused on assessing their personality based on their reactions and behaviors in predefined events. 

Later, their answers for each question were clustered, Word Embedding was applied to express words as vectors and the Latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm connected the vectors in a 'topic model' equation. With only 14 interviews, the machine learning algorithm was able to model 2 distinct topics per question, allowing me to assess the persona of the entrepreneur without having interaction with the actual responses.
